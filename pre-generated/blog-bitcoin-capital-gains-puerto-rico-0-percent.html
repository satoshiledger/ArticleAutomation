                    If you hold a significant amount of Bitcoin and you live on the U.S. mainland, you already know the math: federal capital gains taxes can consume up to 20% of your profits, plus the 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax, plus whatever your state charges on top. For a Bitcoin investor sitting on $1 million in unrealized gains, that tax bill could easily exceed $230,000.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Puerto Rico offers a legal, IRS-recognized path to dramatically reduce&mdash;or even eliminate&mdash;that burden. Under Act 60 of 2019 (Puerto Rico&rsquo;s Incentives Code), bona fide residents who hold a valid tax exemption decree can pay 0% on capital gains that accrue after they establish residency on the island. Because the IRS classifies Bitcoin as property rather than currency (IRS Notice 2014-21), those gains fall squarely under the same capital-gains framework that Act 60 was designed to benefit.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
                    But this opportunity is not a simple loophole, and it is not without limits. House Bill 505, which passed the Puerto Rico legislature in 2025, changes the rate from 0% to 4% for new applicants beginning in 2026. The IRS has launched an active enforcement campaign targeting Act 60 decree holders, including a high-profile criminal prosecution of an investor who attempted to shelter pre-move gains. In this guide, we break down exactly how the Bitcoin capital gains exemption works, what changed in 2026, what the IRS is looking for, and how to structure your relocation compliantly.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-black text-slate-900 mb-6">How Bitcoin Is Taxed Under Federal Law</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Before understanding how Puerto Rico changes the equation, it is essential to understand the federal baseline. In 2014, the IRS released Notice 2014-21, which established the foundational principle that virtual currency is treated as property for federal income tax purposes (IRS, "Notice 2014-21" sec. 4, Q&A-1). This means that every time you sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of Bitcoin, you trigger a taxable event&mdash;just as you would when selling a stock or a piece of real estate.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    The IRS reinforced and expanded this framework in Revenue Ruling 2019-24 and again with Revenue Ruling 2023-14, which addressed the taxability of staking rewards. The agency has continued adding detail through a series of Chief Counsel Advice memoranda and the 2024 digital asset information reporting regulations, making it clear that Bitcoin holders face the same gain-or-loss calculations as holders of any other form of investment property (IRS, "Digital Assets").

                        <p><strong>Short-term (held &lt; 1 year):</strong> Taxed as ordinary income&mdash;up to 37% at the highest federal bracket.</p>
                        <p><strong>Long-term (held &ge; 1 year):</strong> Taxed at 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on your taxable income.</p>
                        <p><strong>Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT):</strong> An additional 3.8% surtax applies above certain income thresholds.</p>
                        <p><strong>State taxes:</strong> Add anywhere from 0% (states like Florida and Texas) up to 13.3% (California) on top of federal rates.</p>

                <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
                    For a Bitcoin holder in a high-tax state like California or New York, the combined effective rate on a long-term capital gain can exceed 33%. That is the baseline cost that Puerto Rico&rsquo;s Act 60 aims to eliminate for qualifying residents.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Section 2: How Act 60 Works for Bitcoin -->

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-black text-slate-900 mb-6">How Act 60 Eliminates Bitcoin Capital Gains Tax</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Puerto Rico&rsquo;s Act 60 (formally the Puerto Rico Incentives Code, enacted July 1, 2019) consolidated more than 76 separate tax incentive laws into a single unified code. Chapter 2 of the law&mdash;the Individual Resident Investor provision, formerly known as Act 22&mdash;provides qualifying bona fide residents with a complete exemption from Puerto Rico income tax on three categories of passive income: capital gains, dividends, and interest (Act 60-2019, Section 2021.01(a)).
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Separately, federal law under IRC Section 933 excludes Puerto Rico-sourced income from U.S. federal income tax for individuals who qualify as bona fide residents of Puerto Rico for the entire taxable year (26 U.S.C. &sect; 933). When these two provisions work together, the result is that a qualifying Bitcoin investor who realizes gains after establishing residency can pay 0% to both Puerto Rico and the federal government on those post-move gains.
                </p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-black text-green-900 mb-4"><i class="fas fa-coins mr-2"></i> The Two-Law Framework That Produces 0%</h3>
                    <div class="space-y-3 text-green-800">
                        <p><strong>Act 60 Chapter 2 (Puerto Rico law):</strong> Exempts PR-sourced capital gains, dividends, and interest from Puerto Rico income tax for decree holders.</p>
                        <p><strong>IRC Section 933 (federal law):</strong> Excludes PR-sourced income from U.S. federal income tax for bona fide PR residents.</p>
                        <p><strong>Combined effect:</strong> Post-move Bitcoin appreciation is exempt from both Puerto Rico and federal income tax, producing an effective 0% rate.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    It is critical to understand that this exemption applies only to gains that accrue <em>after</em> you establish bona fide residency in Puerto Rico. Bitcoin appreciation that occurred while you were living on the mainland remains U.S.-sourced income, subject to standard federal capital gains rates. The IRS uses a special 10-year lookback rule under Treasury Regulation &sect; 1.937-2(f) to ensure that pre-move appreciation on investment property is not treated as Puerto Rico-sourced (Holland &amp; Knight).
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
                    For Bitcoin specifically, because it is classified as property and gains are sourced to the taxpayer&rsquo;s residence at the time of sale under IRC &sect; 865, you must be able to demonstrate that you were a genuine bona fide resident of Puerto Rico at the moment of disposition. The IRS has stated it will rigorously enforce this requirement, particularly for crypto traders (Holland &amp; Knight).
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    The single most important concept for any Bitcoin investor considering Puerto Rico is the distinction between pre-move and post-move appreciation. Getting this wrong is the fastest route to an IRS audit&mdash;or worse, a criminal prosecution.

On the day you establish bona fide residency in Puerto Rico, Bitcoin is trading at $80,000 per coin (total value: $800,000).

                    To properly calculate this split, you must establish the fair market value of your Bitcoin holdings as of the date you become a bona fide resident. For Bitcoin and other publicly traded digital assets, this is relatively straightforward&mdash;you take a snapshot of the market price on your move date. You should document this with exchange screenshots, timestamped price records, and ideally a contemporaneous memo prepared by your CPA (TokenTax).

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-black text-slate-900 mb-4">The 5% Toll Tax Election</h3>
                <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Act 60 Section 2021.01(e) provides an optional election: instead of paying standard U.S. capital gains rates on your pre-move appreciation, you can elect to pay a one-time 5% toll tax to Puerto Rico on the unrealized gain as of your move date. This can be advantageous if your pre-move gains are large and you would otherwise face a combined federal-plus-state rate significantly higher than 5%.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
                    However, the toll tax election requires careful analysis. You must weigh the immediate 5% cost against the possibility that you might never sell the pre-move portion, or that rates could change in the future. A qualified Puerto Rico CPA should model both scenarios for your specific holdings before you make this irrevocable election.

                    The Puerto Rico legislature passed House Bill 505 in 2025, introducing the most significant change to the Individual Resident Investor program since Act 60 was enacted. The bill was approved by the House of Representatives on April 28, 2025 and by the Senate on June 25, 2025 (San Juan Daily Star).

                        <p><strong>New 4% tax rate:</strong> Individuals who apply for an Act 60 Individual Investor decree on or after January 1, 2026 will pay a 4% fixed tax on capital gains, interest, and dividends&mdash;up from the previous 0% (San Juan Daily Star).</p>
                        <p><strong>Grandfathering clause:</strong> Existing decree holders and those who submitted applications before January 1, 2026 retain the 0% rate for the life of their decree&mdash;up to 15 years with an optional 15-year extension.</p>

                    For Bitcoin investors applying in 2026 and beyond, the practical impact is that post-move capital gains will be taxed at 4% instead of 0%. While this is a meaningful change, it still represents an enormous reduction compared to mainland rates. A Bitcoin holder in California facing a combined 33%+ rate would still save approximately 29 cents on every dollar of gain by relocating to Puerto Rico under the new structure.

                <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
                    The 4% rate also aligns with the Act 60 Chapter 3 export services corporate rate, creating a more uniform incentive structure across the program. Puerto Rico&rsquo;s government has framed the change as a step toward long-term program sustainability while maintaining competitive positioning against global tax jurisdictions (News Is My Business).

Gajwani attempted to retroactively convert his Delaware C corporation to an S corporation to take advantage of Act 60 pass-through treatment for pre-move stock gains. The IRS determined the filing was intentionally misleading, and Gajwani ultimately pleaded guilty, facing restitution of approximately $15.3 million (U.S. Department of Justice).

                <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Beyond Gajwani, the Senate Finance Committee has opened its own investigation into Act 60 abuse, with Ranking Member Ron Wyden sending letters to high-profile investors questioning whether pre-move crypto and partnership gains were being improperly sourced to Puerto Rico (Senate Finance Committee).

                    The Holland &amp; Knight analysis published in November 2025 summarized the current state clearly: Act 60 is a statutory regime built on precise sourcing rules, and the IRS will enforce those rules rigorously, especially for cryptocurrency. The benefits are real, but only for those who fully comply (Holland &amp; Knight).

                    As a rough rule of thumb, the breakeven point for most investors&mdash;accounting for compliance costs, the real estate requirement, and professional advisory fees&mdash;typically falls somewhere around $100,000 to $150,000 in annual post-move capital gains. Above that threshold, the savings accelerate quickly. Below it, you should carefully evaluate whether the lifestyle change and ongoing costs are justified.
